# Understanding the Logarithmic Scale for AgentBench Score

## What is a Logarithmic Scale?

A logarithmic scale is a way of displaying numerical data over a wide range of values in a compact way. Unlike a linear scale where equal steps correspond to equal absolute changes, a logarithmic scale represents equal steps as equal percentage or multiplicative changes.

## Why Use a Logarithmic Scale for AI Benchmark Scores?

The AgentBench Score in our risk assessment tool uses a logarithmic scale for several important reasons:

1. **Representing Exponential Improvements**: AI capabilities often improve exponentially rather than linearly. Small numerical improvements at high benchmark scores can represent massive capability jumps.

2. **Sensitivity at Lower Ranges**: A logarithmic scale provides more granular control for lower values, where small absolute changes can significantly impact risk calculations.

3. **Reflecting Real-World AI Progress**: The development of AI capabilities often follows logarithmic patterns, where initial progress is rapid followed by diminishing returns as capabilities approach theoretical limits.

4. **Range Compression**: The logarithmic scale compresses a wide range of values (0.1 to 10.0) into a usable interface element while maintaining meaningful distinctions across the entire range.

## How to Interpret the AgentBench Score Slider

Our AgentBench Score slider ranges from 0.1 to 10.0 on a logarithmic scale:

- **Lower End (0.1-1.0)**: In this range, small movements of the slider result in small absolute changes in the score. This region represents less capable AI systems with limited agency.

- **Middle Range (1.0-5.0)**: This range represents moderate capability AI systems. The slider becomes less sensitive here, with the same slider movement resulting in larger absolute changes compared to the lower end.

- **Upper End (5.0-10.0)**: At this end of the scale, small slider movements result in significant absolute changes in the score. This represents highly capable AI systems where small benchmark improvements represent substantial capability jumps.

## Visual Indicators

The logarithmic nature of the scale is visually indicated by:

1. The "Logarithmic Scale" label below the slider
2. The "Exponential Improvement â†’" indicator that signals increasing returns as you move right on the slider
3. The precision in the displayed value (showing two decimal places)

## Example: Interpreting Score Changes

- **Change from 0.1 to 0.2**: A 100% increase in capability, requiring a significant slider movement
- **Change from 1.0 to 2.0**: A 100% increase in capability, requiring a moderate slider movement
- **Change from 5.0 to 10.0**: A 100% increase in capability, requiring a small slider movement

This non-linear relationship more accurately reflects how small improvements in already-capable AI systems can dramatically increase both their utility and potential risk exposure.

## Impact on Risk Calculations

The logarithmic scale has a direct impact on the derived risk parameters:

- **Number of Attacks**: Increases exponentially with higher AgentBench scores
- **Spearphishing Success**: More sensitive to changes in AgentBench at the upper end
- **Financial Severity**: Compounds with other metrics, amplifying the effect of high AgentBench scores

This approach provides a more realistic risk assessment as it better captures how incremental improvements in advanced AI models can lead to disproportionate changes in capability and associated risk.
